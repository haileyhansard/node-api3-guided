# Node API 3 Guided Project

Guided project for **Node API** module 3.

In this project we will learn how to create a very simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`, and learn to use and create `Express Middleware`.

## Prerequisites

- A REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.

## Project Setup

- [ ] import this repository into your account.
- [ ] clone your version of the repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned the repository.
- [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies.

Please follow along as the instructor creates and adds `middleware` to the API step by step.

## 3 TYPES OF MIDDLEWARE (depending on how we got it)
1. built-in: no need to npm install
2. third-party: needs to be installed using npm
3. custom: we write it!

## Types (depending on how its used)
- global: applies to all requests (that come after the middleware is used)
- local: applies only to a set of endpoints/routes/routers
